PointNet
PointNet is a deep learning model designed for processing and analyzing point cloud data, which represents three-dimensional (3D) spatial information.

Point clouds are collections of points in 3D space, often obtained from 3D sensors like LiDAR or depth cameras.

PointNet was introduced in the paper titled "PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation" by Charles R. Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, and Leonidas J. Guibas, which was presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2017.

Input:
PointNet takes a set of 3D points as input, where each point is represented by its (x, y, z) coordinates. The input can be a variable-sized point cloud, making PointNet applicable to different scenarios with varying numbers of points.

Architecture:
PointNet's architecture is designed to be permutation invariant, meaning that the model's output should be the same regardless of the order of the input points. This is crucial for processing point clouds, as the order of the points may vary. The architecture employs a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to process each point independently, extracting local features. A symmetric function (max pooling) is then applied to aggregate information from all points into a global feature vector, capturing the overall structure of the point cloud.

# Point Net Backbone (main Architecture)
class PointNetBackbone(nn.Module):
    '''
    This is the main portion of Point Net before the classification and segmentation heads.
    The main function of this network is to obtain the local and global point features, 
    which can then be passed to each of the heads to perform either classification or
    segmentation. The forward pass through the backbone includes both T-nets and their 
    transformations, the shared MLPs, and the max pool layer to obtain the global features.

    The forward function either returns the global or combined (local and global features)
    along with the critical point index locations and the feature transformation matrix. The
    feature transformation matrix is used for a regularization term that will help it become
    orthogonal. (i.e. a rigid body transformation is an orthogonal transform and we would like
    to maintain orthogonality in high dimensional space). "An orthogonal transformations preserves
    the lengths of vectors and angles between them"
